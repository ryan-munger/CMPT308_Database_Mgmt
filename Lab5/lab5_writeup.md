## 3. Procedure

### Part 1: *Queries*

*For each question, write the query. Then, use AI to generate the queries and grade its response.*

1. Show all the People data (and only people data) for people who are customers. Use joins this time; no subqueries.

SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *

2. Show all the People data (and only the people data) for people who are agents. Use joins this time; no subqueries.

SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```

SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```
Grade: 

4. Show the first name of customers who have never placed an order. Use subqueries.
```sql
-- Me
SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```
Grade: 

5. Show the Jirst name of customers who have never placed an order. Use one inner and one outer join.
```sql

SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```
Grade: 

6. Show the id and commission percent of Agents who booked an order for the Customer whose id is 007, sorted by commission percent from high to low. Use joins; no subqueries.

-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```
Grade: 

7. Show the last name, home city, and commission percent of Agents who booked an order for the customer whose id is 001, sorted by commission percent from high to low. Use joins.

SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```
Grade: 

8. Show the last name and home city of customers who live in a city that makes the fewest different kinds of products. (Hint: Use count, group by, and having on the Products table in a subquery.)
```sql

SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```
Grade: 

9. Show the name and id of all Products ordered through any Agent who booked at least one order for a Customer in Oyster Bay, sorted by product name from A to Z. You can use joins or subqueries. Better yet, impress me by doing it both ways.
```sql

SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```
Grade: 

10. Show the first and last name of customers and agents living in the same city, along with the name of their shared city. (Living in a city with yourself does not count, so exclude those from your results.)
```sql

SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
-- AI
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```
